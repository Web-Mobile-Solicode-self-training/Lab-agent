# Quality & Security
- **Security**: Always use `auth` middleware and Gates for authorization. Sanitize all inputs via Request classes.
- **Clean Code**: Extract logic from Controllers to Services or Form Requests.
- **Frontend**: Ensure Alpine components are self-contained.
- **Semantics**: Use proper ARIA and semantic HTML.
- **Performance**: Optimize Eloquent queries (no N+1).
